      <h3>Mexican Lasagna! No lasagana Noodles needed</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a traditional dish in my family. Anyone can make it really. It is <br />
        composed of traditional Mexican ingredients layered over the top of one another <br /> 
        in a lasagna-like fashion (hence the name) but has little similarity to lasagna,<br />
        so lasagna haters have no fear!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> ½ pounds ground beef</li>
          <li>¼ cup water</li>
          <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix </li>
          <li>12 (8 inch) flour tortillas, or more if needed</li>
          <li>1 (14 ounce) can refried beans</li>
          <li>3 cups shredded Colby-Jack cheese</li>
          <li>1 (8 ounce) jar taco sauce</li>

        <h2>Steps/Directions</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
          <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in ground beef. Cook and stir<br />
             until beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Drain<br />
            and discard any excess grease. Add water and taco seasoning; cook and stir until mixture<br />
             has thickened, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
             <li>Arrange 3 tortillas in the bottom of the casserole dish; spread about half the can<br />
            of refried beans and half the ground beef atop the tortilla layer. Sprinkle 1 cup<br />
            Colby-Jack cheese over ground beef layer. Arrange 3 more tortillas over the cheese. Spread<br />
            in the remaining 1/2 can refried beans and half the jar of taco sauce; sprinkle with 1 cup<br />
            Colby-Jack cheese. Arrange 3 more tortillas and top with remaining ground beef and 1 cup<br />
            Colby-Jack cheese. Top with last 3 tortillas and remaining 1/2 jar taco sauce.</li>
             <li>Bake in the preheated oven until top tortilla layer begins to brown, 20 to 25 minutes.<br />
            Sprinkle 1 cup Colby-Jack cheese over lasagna.</li>
             <li>Turn on oven's broiler.</li>
             <li>Place lasagna under the broiler until Colby-Jack cheese is melted and bubbling, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
